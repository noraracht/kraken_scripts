# Access to the data used for Kraken benchmarking

This repository contains summary data tables and scripts we used to processes them.

* [my-data-output_true_H.csv](https://github.com/noraracht/kraken_scripts/blob/master/my-data-output_true_H.csv) contains distance estimated before and after filtering for simulated Drosophila genomes with overlapping contaminant and actual percent overlap between contamintn poritions computed based on $k$-mer analysis. [dros-overlap-exp-Tol-db.R](https://github.com/noraracht/kraken_scripts/blob/master/dros-overlap-exp-Tol-db.R) script takes this data table as an input [my-data-output_true_H.csv](https://github.com/noraracht/kraken_scripts/blob/master/my-data-output_true_H.csv) and generates results for contamination overlap experiment.


* Query summary reports and distance matrices used for simulation experiment with non overlapping contaminants:

# Access to the data used for Kraken benchmarking

This repository contains summary data tables and scripts we used to processes them.


* Filtering on simulated Drosophila genome skims with non overlapping contaminant portions.
    - [Drosophila_contam_both_species_formatted.xls](https://github.com/noraracht/kraken_scripts/blob/master/Drosophila_contam_both_species_formatted.xls) contains information about genomic distances estimated before and after filtering for simulated Drosophila genomes where only one of the species was contaminated. [E4_script_NO_conf.R](https://github.com/noraracht/kraken_scripts/blob/master/E4_script_NO_conf.R) script takes this data table as an input and generates results for experiment represented in Fig. 4a.
     - [Drosophila_contam_both_species_formatted_withAlpha.xls](https://github.com/noraracht/kraken_scripts/blob/master/Drosophila_contam_both_species_formatted_withAlpha.xls) summarizes information about genomic distances estimated before and after filtering for the same experiment as above but reported for *k* = {28, 32, 35} and *Î±* = {0.00, 0.05}. [E3_script_two_conf.R](https://github.com/noraracht/kraken_scripts/blob/master/E3_script_two_conf.R) script takes this data table as an input and generates results plot in Fig. S8.

* Filtering on simulated Drosophila genome skims with overlapping contaminant portions.
    - [my-data-output_true_H.csv](https://github.com/noraracht/kraken_scripts/blob/master/my-data-output_true_H.csv) includes information about genomic distances estimated before and after filtering for simulated Drosophila skims with overlapping contaminants. Data also include actual percent overlap between contaminant portions computed throught *k*\-mer analysis. [dros-overlap-exp-Tol-db.R](https://github.com/noraracht/kraken_scripts/blob/master/dros-overlap-exp-Tol-db.R) script takes this data table as an input and generates results for experiment shown in Fig. 4b.


* Filtering real Drosophila genome skims.
    - [sum_report_skmer_14dros_real_cleaned_kraken_std_unmasked_0.0_k35.csv](sum_report_skmer_14dros_real_cleaned_kraken_std_unmasked_0.0_k35.csv) has information about percentages of reads classified by Kraken.
    - [drosophilaskims.csv](https://github.com/noraracht/kraken_scripts/blob/master/drosophilaskims.csv) contains relative distance error before and after filtering for every pair of Drosophila skims.
    - [E3_script_dros_real_noABS2.R](https://github.com/noraracht/kraken_scripts/blob/master/E3_script_dros_real_noABS2.R) script takes [sum_report_skmer_14dros_real_cleaned_kraken_std_unmasked_0.0_k35.csv](sum_report_skmer_14dros_real_cleaned_kraken_std_unmasked_0.0_k35.csv) and [drosophilaskims.csv](https://github.com/noraracht/kraken_scripts/blob/master/drosophilaskims.csv) tables above as an input and generates results for Figs. 5a, 5c, S9, S10.
    - [Drosophila_C_to_different_domains.csv](https://github.com/noraracht/kraken_scripts/blob/master/Drosophila_C_to_different_domains.csv) has percentages classified by Kraken for every species at different domain levels.
    - [Stacked_bar_plot_dros_dif_domains2.R](https://github.com/noraracht/kraken_scripts/blob/master/Stacked_bar_plot_dros_dif_domains2.R) script takes [Drosophila_C_to_different_domains.csv](https://github.com/noraracht/kraken_scripts/blob/master/Drosophila_C_to_different_domains.csv) as an input and generates plot in Fig. 5b.
    
    
* Sensitivity analysis of Kraken
    - [summary_report_kraken_viral_dist_unmasked_0.0_corrected_k35.csv](https://github.com/noraracht/kraken_scripts/blob/master/summary_report_kraken_viral_dist_unmasked_0.0_corrected_k35.csv) contains percent read classified at domain level or lower for every query sequence. It serves as an input for  [Cmnds_inScript_E1.R](https://github.com/noraracht/kraken_scripts/blob/master/Cmnds_inScript_E1.R) script to generate results depicted in Fig. S5 and S6. 
    
     - [export_df_all_data_extended.csv](https://github.com/noraracht/kraken_scripts/blob/master/export_df_all_data_extended.csv) contains FN, FP, TP, TN, FPR, recall computed per bin. It is an input for  [Cmnds_inScript_E2_extended.R](https://github.com/noraracht/kraken_scripts/blob/master/Cmnds_inScript_E2_extended.R) script to generate ROC curves depicted in Fig. 3 and S7.
   

   - [E1_exp_parser_viralDB.ipynb](https://github.com/noraracht/kraken_scripts/blob/master/E1_exp_parser_viralDB.ipynb) script to extract data about percent reads classified at domain level or below.
   
    - [kraken_report_parser_for binned output](https://github.com/noraracht/kraken_scripts/blob/master/kraken_report_viral_parser_v3_binned_conf_matrix_for_contamination-checkpoint.ipynb) reads output reports and computes statistics at the bin level. Also requires, 10kmatrix and keep_exclude files.
